## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

This project served as a crash course for me as I have not used HTML or CSS for a year and I would like to improve my skillset as a designer.

### Continued development

For future projects I would like to continue learning and developing my css and responsive layout design skill set. Eventually I'd want to add Java Script to my arsenal.
